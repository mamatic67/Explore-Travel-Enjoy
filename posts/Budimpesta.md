Over 15 million gallons of water bubble into Budapest's 118 springs and boreholes every day. That number points to the astounding array of baths in this city, from the sparkling Gellert Baths to the vast 1913 neo-baroque Szechenyi Spa to Rudas Spa, a dramatic 16th-century Turkish pool with original Ottoman architecture. The "Queen of the Danube" is also steeped in history, culture, and natural beauty. Get your camera ready for the Hungarian Parliament Building, Heroes' Square, and the Danube at sunset.


# H1 Hungarian Parliament Building

The domed neo-Gothic structre was inspired by the British House of Parliament and serves as both a vibrant government center and a proud city landmark on the banks of the Danube.
